# Changelog

## 0.13.3 — 2026-09-03

- **`bw sync` no longer fails with `object not found` / `packfile not found` or silently corrupts the beadwork branch** — `git fetch` can trigger auto-gc, which repacks the object database out of process and deletes packfiles that `bw`'s long-lived in-memory git handle still had indexed. Depending on timing, sync would either die with:

  ```
  error: walk local commits: object not found
  ```

  or, worse, read a merge input as *empty* and write a merge commit that wiped the branch's contents. Sync now reopens its git state after every successful fetch, so it always sees the freshly-fetched objects and refs. As defense in depth, merge inputs that can't be read are now hard errors instead of being treated as empty trees, commit walks that fail partway abort instead of returning a short ancestor set, and both the merge and the push refuse to produce a beadwork branch that is missing `.bwconfig`. A regression test reproduces the external-repack scenario end to end. (Fixes #138.)

- **`install.sh` no longer gets rate-limited** — the installer looked up the latest release via `api.github.com`, which allows only 60 unauthenticated requests per hour per IP. On shared egress (CI runners, office NATs) this frequently failed with "could not determine latest version". It now follows the unauthenticated `github.com/.../releases/latest` redirect instead, which has no rate limit.

## 0.13.2 — 2026-06-19

- **`bw close --recursive` / `-r`** — close an issue *and its entire subtree* in a single commit. Descendants close leaf-up (children before parents); already-closed members are skipped silently, so a re-run mops up stragglers. The root records your `--reason` verbatim while each descendant records `closed with parent <root-id>`. External issues that become fully unblocked are surfaced (and deduped); unblocks internal to the subtree are suppressed as noise. The non-recursive path is unchanged.

  ```
  $ bw close epic-abc --recursive
  ```

- **`bw ready` surfaces work hidden under claimed-but-open epics and deferred parents** — two cases where the live frontier could vanish are fixed:
  - Running `bw start <child>` moves only that child to `in_progress` without promoting its parent epic. The epic stayed `open` as a display root and suppressed its whole subtree, so `bw ready` collapsed to just the epic. It now drills in and surfaces the open, unblocked siblings.
  - A future-deferred epic acted as a display root and hid its open, unblocked children from the global ready list. Those children now appear (under a `❄` deferred-parent marker).

## 0.13.1 — 2026-05-30

- **No more `ref moved` errors under concurrent use** — commands that change issue state (`start`, `create`, `update`, `delete`, `reopen`, `attach`, `label`, `comment`, `defer`, `undefer`, `dep add`/`remove`) used to die with an error like:

  ```
  error: commit failed: ref moved: ref refs/heads/beadwork (expected f2105ed3, got 3e642ee7)
  ```

  This happened whenever something else moved the beadwork branch mid-command — another `bw` in a second terminal, a background `bw sync`, or an agent working in a worktree. Only `bw close` knew how to recover; every other command lost its work and made you retry by hand. Now all mutating commands automatically refresh against the latest state and retry (up to 12 attempts, with exponential backoff and jitter so colliding writers spread out), so the command just succeeds instead of erroring. Also fixed a latent snapshot-tracking bug in the underlying store that could spuriously trigger the same error.

## 0.13.0 — 2026-05-11

- **`bw recap`** — shows recent beadwork activity across one or more repos. By default it's cursor-driven and incremental: the first run backfills the last 24 hours, then each subsequent run picks up from where it left off. Pass an explicit window (`bw recap today`, `--since 2026-05-01`) to override. `bw recap --all` fans out across every registered repo. Gap detection refuses to advance the cursor if an explicit window would skip unseen history.

- **Host-local repository registry** — a host-local registry tracks which repos have beadwork initialized. When `registry.auto` is enabled in the global config, `bw` registers the current repo automatically after each successful command. `bw registry list` shows all registered repos; `bw registry prune` removes entries whose paths no longer exist.

- **Cross-repo issue resolution** — `bw show r0-abc` resolves `r0` to the registered repo with that prefix and opens that store directly, without `cd`-ing. `-C` now accepts a registered prefix as well as a path (`bw -C r0 list`).

- **Smarter `bw sync` / `bw init` remote selection** — when multiple remotes exist, both commands now pick one via a short-circuit chain: existing beadwork branch → `git config beadwork.remote` → remote named `origin` → interactive menu (TTY only). The menu persists the choice to `git config beadwork.remote`. Previously `bw sync` would push to every remote with the beadwork branch, which was surprising in fork setups.

- **Ticket attachments** — `bw attach <ticket-id> <file-path>` stores an arbitrary file under `attachments/<ticket-id>/<path>` on the beadwork ref. Attachments ride along with normal sync (same ref, same commit), survive sync-conflict resets, and are readable via `Store.GetAttachment`. Designed to back review annotation workflows that need to reference uncommitted file content.

- **`bw ready` now surfaces children of in-progress epics** — previously, when every top-level epic was `in_progress`, `bw ready` returned nothing. The fix walks claimed roots downward to find the shallowest open descendant and uses that as the display root. The "Currently available work" section in `bw prime` gains a one-line icon legend (`○ open  ◐ in progress`) so the grouping is clear.

- **`worktreeConfig` extension fix** — `bw` crashed with `does not support extension: worktreeconfig` on any repo where a user had run `git config --worktree ...`. The extension is now silently stripped before go-git's extension check; bw doesn't read per-worktree config so bypassing it is safe.

- **Reject child-blocks-ancestor dependencies** — `bw dep add` now rejects edges where a descendant blocks one of its own ancestors (in addition to the existing cycle check). A descendant blocking its ancestor is a logical contradiction — the ancestor can never become unblocked.

## 0.12.3 — 2026-04-12

- **`bw ready <parent-id>`** — scope the ready list to a single subtree. Pass any issue ID as a positional argument and `bw ready` returns only the actionable descendants of that parent (the parent itself is excluded). Useful for focusing on what's unblocked within a specific epic or workstream without seeing every ready item in the repo. Without an argument, behavior is unchanged.

## 0.12.2 — 2026-04-12

- **Subtree blocker display fix** — `bw ready` epics with children no longer show `[blocked by: ...]` annotations for their own descendants. The subtree-aware classification added in 0.12.1 correctly identified these epics as ready, but the display layer still rendered internal blocker IDs, making ready epics look blocked. Internal blockers are now filtered from annotations alongside closed blockers.

## 0.12.1 — 2026-04-07

- **Subtree-aware `bw ready` and `bw blocked`** — epics with children are now classified based on their full subtree instead of individually. If all blockers are internal to the subtree, the parent shows as ready and descendants are suppressed from both lists. If any descendant has an external blocker, the parent shows as blocked with those external blocker IDs aggregated. This reduces noise for projects with deep issue hierarchies — you see the actionable root, not every leaf.

## 0.12.0 — 2026-04-02

- **Due dates** — new `--due` flag on `bw create` and `bw update` sets deadlines without changing issue status. `bw list --overdue` filters to past-due items. Overdue items float to the top within their priority band in `bw list` and `bw ready`, and show an `(OVERDUE since YYYY-MM-DD)` marker in `bw show`. Clear a due date with `bw update <id> --due ""`. Date-only values use end-of-day semantics: `due: "2027-04-15"` isn't overdue until April 16.

- **Time-granular dates** — `bw defer` and the `--due`/`--defer` flags now accept time expressions: `in 15 minutes`, `tomorrow at 2pm`, `3pm`, `14:00`, or full RFC3339. Sub-day values are stored as RFC3339 with your local timezone offset. Date-only expressions (`2027-06-01`, `next monday`) continue to produce plain `YYYY-MM-DD`.

- **Query-time deferral expiry** — deferred items whose `defer_until` has passed now reappear in `bw ready` and default `bw list` automatically — no poller or cron needed. On-disk status stays `deferred`; the expiry is evaluated at query time. `bw defer bw-abc "in 15 minutes"` just works. `bw prime` surfaces expired deferrals in a dedicated "Reminders" section. `bw list --deferred` still shows all deferred items regardless of expiry, and `bw undefer` still works for manual cleanup.

- **Export/import pass-through** — `defer_until` and `due` fields pass through as-is in export/import. No more `T00:00:00Z` padding on export or time stripping on import. Old exports with padded values import without error.

- **Sort order change** — issues now sort by priority ascending, then overdue-first within each priority band, then creation date ascending.

- **Agent guidance** — `bw prime` now includes due-date/deferral guidance, a date expression reference, overdue count, and a reminders section for expired deferrals.

- **Note**: Mixed-version usage (old binary reading new issue data) will silently drop the `due` field on write-back. Data is recoverable from git history.

## 0.11.8 — 2026-04-01

- **`-C <dir>` flag** — run `bw` as if started in `<dir>`, matching `git -C` semantics. The repo is discovered from the specified directory without changing the process working directory. Useful for scripting against a different repo or running `bw` from outside a checkout: `bw -C /path/to/repo list`.

- **`bw onboard` pipe-friendly output** — when stdout is not a TTY (e.g. `bw onboard | pbcopy` or `bw onboard >> CLAUDE.md`), only the raw snippet text is emitted, without headings, code fences, or the "How it works" section. TTY output is unchanged.

- Minor prime prompt wording adjustments.

## 0.11.7 — 2026-03-25

- **Cyclic dependency rejection** — `bw dep add` now rejects edges that would create circular dependencies (e.g. A blocks B, B blocks C, then C blocks A). Previously only self-loops were caught; transitive cycles were silently accepted, creating logically incoherent state where blocked issues could never become unblocked. The check uses a DFS walk of the reachable subgraph, consistent with the existing parent-child cycle detection.

## 0.11.6 — 2026-03-13

- **Compact dependency annotations** — issues that block (or are blocked by) multiple others now show a single grouped annotation instead of one per ID. For example, `[blocks: bw-a, bw-b]` instead of two separate `[blocks: bw-a]` `[blocks: bw-b]` tags. Reduces visual noise in `bw list` and `bw ready` output, especially for epics with many children.

- **`bw show` simplified to single ID** — `bw show` now accepts exactly one issue ID instead of multiple. Multi-ID usage was rare in practice and made JSON output awkward (array vs object). `bw show --json` now returns a plain JSON object instead of a single-element array, which is easier to pipe into `jq` and other tools.

## 0.11.5 — 2026-03-13

- **`bw ls` alias** — `ls` is now an alias for `bw list`, saving a few keystrokes for the most common query command.

- **`--parent` filter for `bw list`** — filter issues by parent ID to see only children of a given epic. Example: `bw list --parent bw-a3f8`. Useful when reviewing progress on a specific epic without noise from unrelated work.

## 0.11.4 — 2026-03-10

- **Bug fix: false "uncommitted changes" warning** — `bw prime` and `bw ready` could report uncommitted changes on a clean working tree. The dirty-tree check used go-git's in-process status, which disagrees with real git on worktree boundaries and file modes. Now uses `git diff --quiet HEAD`, which is both correct and faster on large repos.

- Updated go-git to v5.17.0.

## 0.11.3 — 2026-03-10

- **Bug fix: TTY line wrapping** — lines with dependency annotations (e.g. `[blocks: bw-xyz]`) wrapped prematurely because the wrap engine counted invisible color markers as visible width, overcounting each line by ~51 characters. Most visible on `bw ready` and `bw list` output with `blocks`/`blocked by` annotations.

## 0.11.2 — 2026-03-08

- **Git context in `bw prime` and `bw ready`** — output now shows the current branch, clean/dirty state, and last commit so agents know where they are without a separate `git status`.

- **`bw init` surfaces onboard instructions** — after initializing, `bw init` now tells you about `bw onboard` so new users discover agent integration setup immediately.

- **Standardized worktree branch naming** — the prime prompt now includes a naming convention (`<id>/<short-description>`, e.g. `bw-a1b/fix-auth-bug`) so agents produce consistent branch names.

- **Uncommitted changes warning** — `bw prime` and `bw ready` now warn when the working tree has uncommitted changes.

- **Styled open checkboxes** — TTY output uses `☐` (dimmed) for open checkboxes instead of `[ ]`, matching the `✓` styling for completed items.

- **Blocked status in `bw ready` legend** — the TTY legend now includes the blocked indicator.

- **Bug fix: `bw defer` relative dates** — inputs like "2 weeks" and "next monday" now parse correctly.

- **Bug fix: line wrapping** — bullet items and dependency annotations no longer break mid-word.

- **`--raw` renamed to `--x-raw`** — internal/debug flags now use an `--x-` prefix to distinguish them from stable flags.

## 0.11.1 — 2026-03-08

- **Styled upgrade changelog** — the release notes shown during `bw upgrade` now go through the same markdown rendering pipeline as `bw show` and `bw list`, gaining heading colorization, bold/code inline styling, and terminal-width wrapping.

## 0.11.0 — 2026-03-08

- **Markdown-native output** — `bw show`, `bw list`, `bw ready`, and `bw start` now emit semantic markdown with embedded tokens (`{status:open}`, `{id:bw-xyz}`, etc.) that resolve to styled ANSI on TTY, clean unicode in markdown mode, or raw tokens for debugging. This replaces the old Go template rendering pipeline. Use `--x-render-as tty|markdown|raw` to preview the different modes.

- **Rewritten prime prompt** — `bw prime` is shorter (~300 words, down from ~700) and structured around a delivery-awareness question: _"How should this land?"_ with three tiers — quick fix (no ticket), branch/PR (ticket + worktree), or multi-step (epic). The agent asks the user instead of guessing, which tested more reliably than blanket "every change gets a ticket" rules. Dirty worktree warnings now appear as a prominent `[!WARNING]` block at the top.

- **Agent-agnostic delegation** — the prime prompt no longer references Claude Code–specific tools like `isolation: "worktree"`. Instead it states consequences: _"Each delegated task needs its own worktree… Agents that can't request approvals can't land work — plan accordingly."_ Agents infer the right mechanism on their own. Tested 9/9 on both principle-based and explicit variants.

- **Agent detection** — new `internal/agent` package detects the invoking AI agent (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Cursor) via environment variables, enabling agent-aware behavior in future commands.

- **Improved onboarding** — `bw onboard` now recommends adding the bootstrap prompt to `CLAUDE.md` (not `AGENTS.md`, which Claude Code doesn't read). References are agent-agnostic, mentioning `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, and `COPILOT.md`.

- **Bug fix: closed blockers no longer clutter output** — `bw list` dependency annotations now filter out already-closed blockers.

- **Repositioned as work management** — README reframed from "issue tracking" to "git-native work management." Added Discord community link.

- **Prompt design documentation** — new `docs/prompts/` directory with design requirements for each prompt (`prime.md`, `agents.md`, `start.md`) and a full experimentation methodology (`prompts.md`).

## 0.10.0 — 2026-03-06

- **Automatic upgrade notifications** — `bw` now checks for newer releases once per day (throttled via a local cache). When a new version is found, it creates a P1 upgrade bead with the changelog and instructions to run `bw upgrade`. The bead updates itself if further releases appear, and `bw upgrade` auto-closes it when complete. This runs silently in the background of any store-using command — no new flags or commands required.

- **`bw prime` now includes issue ID prefix** — the prime output resolves `{prefix}` placeholders so agents see the project's actual prefix (e.g., `bw-XYZ`) in the model description, reducing ambiguity about issue ID format.

- **Improved agent onboarding prompt** — the prime directive in `prompts/agents.md` now emphasizes that untracked/unlanded work is effectively void, better aligning with how agents actually lose context across sessions.

- **Project-level AGENTS.md** — replaced the symlink to `prompts/agents.md` with a standalone file describing beadwork's purpose, architecture, and repo structure for agents working on beadwork itself.

## 0.9.0 — 2026-02-28

- **`bw start` is now a full point-of-action briefing** — starting an issue prints type-aware guidance for both beginning and landing the work. Epics get "work through children via `bw ready`" while tasks and bugs get scoped commit steps. Children, dependencies, and comments are rendered inline from the template, so the briefing adapts to each issue type. Comments now always appear regardless of issue type (previously they were missing for non-standard types like `feature`).

- **`bw reopen` accepts in-progress issues** — you can now run `bw reopen` on an `in_progress` issue to reset it to `open` and clear the assignee, returning it to the ready queue without closing first. Useful when you need to unclaim work.

- **`bw ready` sorts by priority** — output is now ordered by priority (P0 first) then creation date, matching `bw list`. Previously the order was arbitrary.

- **`bw prime` shows work in progress** — the prime output now includes a "Work In Progress" section alongside ready work, so you can see what's already claimed at a glance.

- **`bw sync` no longer blocked by pre-push hooks** — the internal push for the beadwork data branch now skips user-configured hooks, which are irrelevant to the data branch and could block syncing.

- **`bw dep remove` errors on non-existent dependencies** — previously succeeded silently; now returns `"no dependency: A does not block B"`.

- **Fixed dependency display bugs** — `bw show` could display sibling issues in the BLOCKED BY section instead of only transitive blockers. `bw ready` and `bw list` showed closed blockers in annotations. Both are fixed.

- **Intent replay fixes** — `bw sync` conflict resolution now correctly replays `start`, `defer`, and `undefer` operations, preserves deterministic IDs during create replay, and encodes descriptions faithfully. These fixes improve reliability when syncing concurrent changes.

- **Improved prompts** — `bw prime` worktree guidance now names the scope-creep temptation ("that related fix is a new ticket") and embeds worktree creation into the "Starting the Work" workflow. `bw start` landing instructions include PR workflow guidance when applicable. Re-run `bw onboard` to pick up the new prompts.

- **Acceptance test harness** — golden-file acceptance tests verify end-to-end command sequences with deterministic state, including export/import round-trip fidelity.

## 0.8.1 — 2026-02-22

- **`bw show` header includes comment count** — the header bracket now shows how many comments an issue has (e.g., `· 3 comments`) or `· NO COMMENTS` when empty, so you can tell at a glance whether there's discussion without scrolling to the bottom.

## 0.8.0 — 2026-02-22

- **`bw start` now shows full issue context** — starting an issue prints the description, children, dependencies, comments, and a "Landing the Work" section with next steps. Delegates get the full picture without needing a separate `bw show`.

- **`bw ready` groups child issues under their parent** — epics and their children are visually grouped with indentation instead of appearing as a flat list. Standalone issues print first, followed by parent/child groups.

- **`bw show` displays children for epics** — a new CHILDREN section lists each child with status, priority, and inline dependency annotations. Use `--only children` to show just the children.

- **`bw comment` replaces `bw comments`** — simplified to a single verb: `bw comment <id> "text"`. The old `bw comments` still works as an alias. Listing comments has moved to `bw show` (which already displayed them).

- **`--dry-run` global flag** — run any command without committing changes to the beadwork branch. Shown in `bw --help` under Global Flags. Useful for previewing what a command would do.

- **Deterministic state for testing** — `bw create --id <ID>` pins the issue ID, and `BW_CLOCK=<RFC3339>` freezes timestamps. Together they make `bw export` output fully reproducible, enabling golden-file acceptance tests.

- **Faster startup** — removed `git` subprocess calls from the hot path (`findGitDir` and `gitUserName` replaced with pure-Go equivalents). Every `bw` invocation is faster, especially on macOS where subprocess startup carries SSH agent overhead.

- **Improved prompts** — `bw prime` and `bw onboard` now include guidance on delegating work to sub-agents, using worktrees, and closing out tickets after verification. If you've customized agent configuration, re-run `bw onboard` to pick up the new prompts.

## 0.7.0 — 2026-02-21

- **New `bw start` command** — claims and begins work on an issue in one step. Validates the issue is open and unblocked, moves it to `in_progress`, and assigns from `git config user.name` (or `--assignee`). If the issue has unresolved blockers, it shows the blocker titles and suggests `bw ready`. The `--assignee` flag has been removed from `bw create` — assignment now means active work, not planning.
- **Actionable tips in `bw show`** — dependency sections now walk the blocker tree to surface only the leaf issues that need work. If A←B←C←D, showing A displays only D. New BLOCKED BY and UNBLOCKS sections replace the old flat dependency lists. Use `--only` to filter output to specific sections (replaces `--short`).
- **`bw graph` removed** — its job is now done better by show's dependency sections.
- **`bw close` strikethroughs the title** for a visual "done" cue.
- **`bw prime` injects project state inline** — ready queue and issue counts now appear in context under "Finding and Doing Work" rather than appended at the end.
- **Reworked `bw prime` and `bw onboard` prompts** — prime now emphasizes landing the work (commit, close, sync) and connects issues to commits. The onboard prompt has also changed — if you've customized your agent configuration based on the old output, re-run `bw onboard` to pick up the new version.
- **Sync uses system git for network operations** — fixes SSH failures on macOS when the SSH agent has no loaded keys.
